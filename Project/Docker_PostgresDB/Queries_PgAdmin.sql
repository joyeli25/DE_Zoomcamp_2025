------------District, Ward, Community Area-----------------------------------
üìç 1. Police District

Purpose: Law enforcement.

Chicago is divided into 22 police districts, each with its own police station.

Example: District 1 = Central (Downtown Loop), District 25 = Grand Central.

Crimes are recorded with the district that responded to or has jurisdiction over that location.

üèõÔ∏è 2. Ward

Purpose: Political boundaries for City Council representation.

Chicago has 50 wards, each represented by an alderman.

Wards are used for legislation, zoning, and political purposes, not policing.

üèòÔ∏è 3. Community Area

Purpose: Research & urban planning.

Chicago has 77 community areas, which are fixed statistical boundaries (unlike wards, which change with redistricting).

Designed in the 1920s by the University of Chicago for consistent sociological and demographic studies.

Example: Hyde Park = Community Area 41, Englewood = Community Area 68.

üîë Relationship Between Them

They often overlap, but they are independent boundary systems:

A single community area may span multiple wards or districts.

A police district might include parts of several community areas.

Wards are political and change with redistricting, but community areas never change (making them good for long-term trend analysis).

üìå What is a Beat?

The smallest police geographic area in Chicago.

Each beat is assigned officers who regularly patrol and know the neighborhood.

Beats roll up into sectors ‚Üí districts ‚Üí areas (hierarchy of CPD).

üèôÔ∏è Hierarchy Example (Chicago PD structure)

Beat ‚Üí Smallest unit (few blocks to a neighborhood).

Sector ‚Üí Group of 3‚Äì5 beats.

District ‚Üí Group of sectors (Chicago has 22 police districts).

Area ‚Üí Larger police area covering multiple districts.

üìä Why it‚Äôs in the data

Every crime is reported at the beat level to track local crime trends.

Used for resource deployment (e.g., more patrols in high-crime beats).

Lets you do fine-grained analysis:

Crime hotspots

Correlation with socioeconomic factors

Comparison across beats, districts, wards, or community areas
